// java does not use destructor as it has garbage collector
/*
Java doesnâ€™t support manual memory deallocation 
Garbage collection removes unused objects from memory on the heap. It helps prevent memory leaks. 
Simply put, when there are no more references to the specific object and the object is no longer accessible,
 the garbage collector marks this object as unreachable and reclaims its space.
